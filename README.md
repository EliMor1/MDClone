# Organization Structure Web App

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
You can run `npm start` which may be equivalent to `ng serve`

Install all dependecies and you're ready to go.

Thanks in advance!
